CUDA template Generator


# Bugs #


  * Under Memory optimization tab, when "auto" is disabled for 1 Array, it also disables for all arrays in the list. But code will be generated correctly.
  * If "Variable" parameter is chosen, but "Auto" is disabled will generate Array instead of variable (soon be fixed)

# Further Improvement plans #
  * Under Block & Thread compute tab when Block & Thread parameters are defined incorrectly - shows only 1 error.
Plan is to describe error with more information.

If you find any other bug. You may describe it  in comment.
